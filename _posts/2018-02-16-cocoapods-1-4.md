[Cocoapods][cocoapods] 1.4 has been released. To update, simply run :
{% highlight shell %}
$ gem update cocoapods
{% endhighlight %}

Alonside with numerous bug fixes, this new version brings some interesting enhancements, including :

- [#7134](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/7134) _Integrate swift_version DSL support into pod targets_

Specify the version of Swift that you support support in a PodSpec :

{% highlight ruby %}
Pod::Spec.new do |s|
  s.name = 'BanannaLib'
  s.version = '1.0.0'
  s.swift_version = '3.2'
  s.source_files = '**/*.swift'
end
{% endhighlight %}


"Ranged" Swift version (ie. `'>= 3.2, < 5'`) might be supported in version 1.5

- [#7092](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/7092) _Add support to integrate script phases from podspecs_

You can now pass a `script_phase` in a PodSpec, very usefull to `lipo` a fat framework and simplify the integration.
> This attribute allows to define a script phase to execute as part of compilation of the Pod.

- [#6820](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/6820) _Add custom shell script integration from Podfile_

Similarily, you can add a `script_phase` in the project Podfile :

{% highlight ruby %}
target 'SampleApp' do
  pod 'Alamofire'
  script_phase :name => 'Hello World', :script => 'echo "Hello World"'
end
{% endhighlight %}

- [#7250](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/7250) _Show warning when SDK provider tries to push a version with an unencrypted HTTP source_

Cocoapods will display a warning if one of the pods you use is downloaded through HTTP :

![Security warning]({{"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DWGVFoHVQAAzgmb.png:large"}})

See [Trusting third party SDKs](https://krausefx.com/blog/trusting-sdks) by Felix Krause

- [#7093](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/7093) _Add support for editing the podspec, license, README, license, and docs of local development pods_

- [#7033](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/7033) _Do not force include the master spec repo if plugins provide sources_
